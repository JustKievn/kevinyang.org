        I am a first-generation Asian-American born and raised in Philadelphia,
        PA. I received my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Drexel
        University in 2019 as part of their 5-Year Co-op Program. During my stay
        at Drexel, I also worked as a developer for Comcast for the last three
        years of my schooling. Balancing school and work was no easy task, but I
        believe the skills and experience I gained from those three years was
        invaluable. My ability to multitask, prioritize, and manage stress was
        put to the test and I became a better engineer as a result.

        I'm currently based in Mount Laurel, NJ and work as a Software Engineer
        for Comcast. I love the work I do and cannot imagine me pursuing any
        other career path. I enjoy tackling complex problems and breaking them
        down into smaller, consumable pieces and I don't think any other
        industry puts those skills to the test more than Software Engineering. I
        love that software engineering is a rapidly evolving field and that I
        will be experiencing it first-hand as I learn the nuisances of
        engineering as it evolves.
